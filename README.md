# Semi-blind-Source-Separation-using-Pre-learned-Demixing-Filters

Source separation from an instantaneous mixture of signals is a challenging problem. Speech that is perfectly understood in a quiet environment is rendered unintelligible in an environment with many interfering sources such as a cocktail party. In this project applications of relative transfer functions (RTFs) to blind source separation (BSS) are investigated. We analyze auxiliary function-based Independant Vector Analysis (auxIVA) and propose methods to estimate the auxiliary variables and demixing matrices in tne Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) domain. In essence we solve the outer permutation ambiguity which is present in auxIVA by introducing prior information about the desired source.
